# *Simple Shell project*

## *Introduction*
This simple shell project is  collaboration between `Eugenia Matto` and `Franco Trenche`, software engineering students. This repository contains the files for this simple_shell project. It consists of developing and making our own UNIX command interpreter (Shell).

The _shell_ is an interface to the operating system. It acts as a command interpreter; it takes each commands and passes it to the operating system.

The aim of this project was to mirror how the real shell (sh) works using a custom version of almost every library function needed. **A simple shell version of the original one.**
